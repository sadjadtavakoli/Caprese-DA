# Run

## Needs a bit of coding action

After installing all dependencies, you should initialize the required constants in "Caprese/constants.js".
The customizable variables include the followings: 
- REPO_URL: Repository url
- REPO_MAIN_BRANCH: The main branchâ€™s name
- REPO_TEST_RELATIVE_DIR: The relative path of the test directory
- REPO_TEST_EXCLUDED_DIRS: the test paths to be excluded from dynamic analysis
- SEED_COMMIT: the commit to start the analysis with
- DATA_PATH: the storage path


You can also modify any other constants based on your unique needs, such as the digging depth of the repository.


## Ready to go

Run the following command to extract dynamic dependencies:
```
node caprese.js extract
```

After this commands, the following command can be used to get the impacted functions by a change set. In this command, the functions provided as input must be between double quotation marks, separated by space, and follow the naming format of *functionName-filePath-firstLine-LastLine*. If the function is anonymous, immediate, or arrow function, you should set the name as *arrowAnonymousFunction*. Also, if the change is in the main body of a file, not in any function, you should only mention the *filePath*. 
* An example of a list of functions: "getAssist-main/assist/getAssists.js-12-18 arrowAnonymousFunction-main/index.js-10-13 index.js"

```
node caprese.js detect "list of functions"
```

The output of this execution will be accessible in "Caprese/capreseResult.json" file.
