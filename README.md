Berke uses NodeProf for its dynamic analysis phase. NodeProf is an efficient instrumentation and profiling framework for [Graal.js](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs).

## Getting started

# RefDiff 
Berke uses a changed version of Refdiff to detect the changed entities (available [here](https://github.com/sadjad-tavakoli/RefDiff.git)).

RefDiff originally is a tool to mine refactorings in the commit history of git repositories. In Berke we changed it to detect changed entities between two different revisions.
