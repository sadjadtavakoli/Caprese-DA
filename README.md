# Caprese
Caprese is a function-level change impact analysis tool for Node.js application that uses Dynamic Analysis and Frequent Pattern Detection. Follow the instruction below to run Caprese.

1- Install dependencies ([check here](#install-dependencies))\
2- Initialize the required constants ([check here](#needs-a-bit-of-coding-action))\
3- It's ready to go! ([check here](#ready-to-go))

------------------------------------------------------------
# Install Dependencies
## dynamic analysis
### Install NodeProf 
Caprese uses NodeProf for its dynamic analysis phase. NodeProf is an efficient instrumentation and profiling framework for [Graal.js](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs).

To install nodeProf, You can follow [this instruction](https://github.com/Haiyang-Sun/nodeprof.js/tree/master/docs/panathon18). 

NodeProf is available under [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
### Other Dependencies
Change your directory to "DA/", then run ```npm install``` in order to install other dependencies.


## frequent pattern detection

### Install RefDiff 
Caprese uses a changed version of Refdiff to detect the changed entities.

RefDiff originally is a tool to mine refactorings in the commit history of git repositories. In Caprese we changed it to detect changed entities between two different revisions.

To install RefDiff, first, make sure you have [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and [java > 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed in your system. Also, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the installation directory of the desired JDK.
Then, change your directory to "refdiff/" and use gradlew to install Refdiff. 

### Install Maven
Install the latest version of [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html), if you do not have it installed already. 

------------------------------------------------------------
# Run

## Needs a bit of coding action

After installing all dependencies, you should initialize the required constants in "Caprese/constants.js".
The customizable variables include the followings: 
- REPO_URL: Repository url
- REPO_MAIN_BRANCH: The main branchâ€™s name
- REPO_TEST_RELATIVE_DIR: The relative path of the test directory
- REPO_TEST_EXCLUDED_DIRS: the test paths to be excluded from dynamic analysis
- FPD_EXCLUDED_DIRS: the paths to be excluded from frequent pattern detection 
- SEED_COMMIT: the commit to start the analysis with
- DATA_PATH: the storage path


You can also modify any other constants based on your unique needs, such as the digging depth of the repository.


## Ready to go

Run the following command to extract dynamic dependencies:
```
node caprese.js da
```

Run the following command to extract sequences:
```
node caprese.js mine
```

After these commands, the following command can be used to get the impacted functions by a change set. In this command, the functions provided as input must be between double quotation marks, separated by space, and follow the naming format of *functionName-filePath-firstLine-LastLine*. If the function is anonymous, immediate, or arrow function, you should set the name as *arrowAnonymousFunction*. Also, if the change is in the main body of a file, not in any function, you should only mention the *filePath*. 
* An example of a list of functions: "getAssist-main/assist/getAssists.js-12-18 arrowAnonymousFunction-main/index.js-10-13 index.js"

```
node caprese.js detect "list of functions"
```

The output of this execution will be accessible in "Caprese/capreseResult.json" file.
